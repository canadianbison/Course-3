Script Function
---------------

The run-analysis.R script creates a clean dataset by performing the
following procedures to the original "Samsung dataset":

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    for each measurement.
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
    set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
    variable for each activity and each subject.
6.  Save the data set to TXT file under the working directory.
